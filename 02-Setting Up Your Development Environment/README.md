You'll need a couple of tools installed on your development system in order to work with Next.js projects.

* Install Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSCode) [Scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras/blob/master/bucket/vscode.json) [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/visual-studio-code)
    * `scoop install vscode` 
    * `brew cask install visual-studio-code` 
* Install Node.js v10.13 or later [Node.js Docs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node)
    * `scoop install nodejs`
    * `brew install node`
* Git
    * `scoop install git`
    * `brew install git`
* (_optional_) [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (Mac / Windows)
* (_optional_) [Canonical Multipass](https://multipass.run)
* (_optional_) [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

You can optionally use Yarn as your package manager, although I tend to prefer using NPM.

Make sure that `npm` and `npx` commands work from the terminal.

## Learning Points

* Visual Studio Code is an excellent editor for JavaScript, and many other languages
* Node.js can easily be installed and updated, using the [Scoop package manager](https://scoop.sh) or [Mac Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
