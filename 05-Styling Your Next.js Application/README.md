## Styling Your Next.js Application

CSS styles can be applied globally to the Next.js application, or at an individual component level.
You can also utilize in-line styles on JSX elements. In-line styles are generally discouraged, because they cannot be reused.

## Learning Points

* CSS files can be stored in the `/public` directory
* Modular styles are supported with `[component].module.css`
* Modular styles help avoid conflicts by generating CSS class names
* You can use the JavaScript `import` statement to parse CSS files as JS objects
* Less and Sass are supported
