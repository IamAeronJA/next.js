Most applications need some kind of authentication mechanism to interact with data. In this module, we'll add authentication to a Next.js application.

Start by creating a new application:

```
npx create-next-app
```

Add the authentication module to the project:

```
npm i next-auth
```

In order to specify environment variables, use the `dotenv` module. Make sure you add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file, as it often contains secrets.

```
npm install dotenv
```

### Configure the API route:

The file must be named `/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`. (_Yes, the file name includes the special characters_)

* Configure the `site` value
* Add one or more OAuth providers

```
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import Providers from 'next-auth/providers'

const options = {
  site: 'http://localhost:3090',
  providers: [
    Providers.GitHub({
        clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
        clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET
    }),
  ],
}

export default (req, res) => NextAuth(req, res, options)
```

### Configure a sample login page:

You'll need a login page to present to the user, so they can choose what type of authentication to use. 

`pages/login.js`

```
import React from 'react'
import { 
  useSession, 
  signin, 
  signout 
} from 'next-auth/client'

export default () => {
  const [ session, loading ] = useSession()

  return <p>
    {!session && <>
      Not signed in <br/>
      <button onClick={signin}>Sign in</button>
    </>}
    {session && <>
      Signed in as {session.user.email} <br/>
      <button onClick={signout}>Sign out</button>
    </>}
  </p>
}
```

## Create GitHub OAuth App

In order to integrate your application with GitHub authentication, you'll need to create an OAuth application in the web interface.

The application ID and secret key need to be configured in your `.env` file.
